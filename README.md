# Adventure
Adventure was a passion project of mine to make an advanced quest editor in Unreal Engine, using my custom Blueprint graph. It was also used on [Outpost: Glacier](https://twitter.com/OutpostGlacier).
It can create branching quests very easily with many different conditions.

[Info about the plugin](https://olssondev.com/adventure-plugin). 

# State of the plugin

It's not currently maintained, but it works, just wanted to put it out there as a learning resource for anyone wanting to learn more about making your own custom graphs/node systems in Unreal Engine 5.
