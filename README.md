# Adventure
Adventure was a passion project of mine to make an advanced quest editor in Unreal Engine, using my custom Blueprint graph. It was also used on [Outpost: Glacier](https://twitter.com/OutpostGlacier) to make quests.

It can create branching quests very easily with many different conditions. It also supports multiplayer out-of-the-box.

It's not currently maintained, but it works, just wanted to put it out there as a learning resource for anyone wanting to learn more about making your own custom graphs/node systems in Unreal Engine 5.
